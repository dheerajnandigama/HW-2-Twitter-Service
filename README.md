COURSE: CMPE- 272 ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE PLATFORM 

ASSIGNMENT HW2: TWITTER 

About:

In this assignment, we have created a website that allows users to create, show and delete Twitter tweets. We have used React as the frontend and Flask as the backend. As we used the basic Twitter developer API plan, we were limited to posting and deleting APIs. As a workaround, we stored user text and tweet IDs locally.

Client Side (Frontend): React
We have used React to create a clear representation of the end-to-end work of the project. Here, the interface shows an input button to create the tweet, display card to reveal tweets and an option to delete the tweet within display card.
 
Server side (Backend): Flask
Here, based on the request received from the front end (React), Using Flask, we trigger the Twitter API to create and delete tweets.
 
Intermediate API: Twitter 
Utilizing the Twitter API to create and delete tweets.

Unit Testing:
Testing functions were added to ensure the functionality of functions and APIs worked as expected for a better user experience.
